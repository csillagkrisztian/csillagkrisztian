Hi I am Krisztián, a student of _Codaisseur_ and soon to be _Junior Full Stack Web Developer_. My project that I take most pride in is Co_Do_It.

◀️ My skills as a developer _for now_ . Language-wise I am comfortable with Javascript and C# as of writing this README. 

🌀 I am in the process of searching for an opportunity, to put my foot in the door and start my new career, life and passion.

Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions or if you want some advice on 🎮 Game Design
